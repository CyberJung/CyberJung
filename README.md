- 👋 Hi, I’m @CyberJung 
I am a persistent and curious specialist with experience in occupational safety, transitioning into the exciting field of cybersecurity. My sense of responsibility and commitment to professionalism motivate me to protect digital data and systems in our modern and unstable world. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to develop new skills such as SQL and Python and plan to begin studying them to enhance my ability to protect data and systems from cyber threats.
